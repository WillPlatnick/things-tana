This is a quick bash script to bring in todos from Things and format them for Tana Paste. 

I'm not 100% sure what my workflow is going to be yet, so it's very likely this will get updated to do something you don't want to do.

This is mostly just a POC. Please feel free to fork and implement your own logic.
